## Development

1. add services@coderbunker to your Gmail alias
2. the script is bounded to the **Coderbunker Onboarding Categorization** spreadsheet, you can open its Script editor to view or edit the code 
3. always use clasp and Git to keep the code up-to-date

## Usage

From a clean start: once you created the Coderbunker Onboarding Categorization spreadsheet and its form, you need to run `onCreateScript()` function at the very beginning to set all the properties and triggers. If you've already ran the function, you don't need to run it again during the entire life of the script.
